# Experience

I've been coding in Javascript for 4 years. In between, I used Python, C++ and Solidity on some projects.

I write mostly bots, backend applications and various parsers. In addition to that, I've had experience in Web3 projects, writing smart contracts. Trying to go more into open-source and taking part in community projects to get some experience in teamwork. 

Currently working on a school project - musical interval coach.
(perhaps here will be description...)
